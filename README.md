## Overview

Welcome to the Trading Dashboard project! This is a comprehensive full-stack application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The backend is a robust Express.js API that handles all data operations, while the frontend is a dynamic and responsive user interface designed to provide a seamless user experience.

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
- **Frontend:** React.js, React Router DOM
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas

- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
- **State Management:** React Context API

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Full-Stack Architecture:** A complete MERN stack implementation from database to UI.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Users can sign up to view a personalized dashboard displaying their portfolio data.
- **Rich Data Visualization:** Utilizes **Chart.js** to render beautiful and informative doughnut charts and histograms for financial data analysis.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Employs **React Router DOM** for a smooth, single-page application (SPA) experience with seamless navigation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### 2. Navigate to Project Folders & Install Dependencies

This project has three main folders: `frontend`, `dashboard`, and `backend`. You need to install dependencies for each one.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../dashboard
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

In the `backend` directory, create a new file named `.env`:

```bash
# backend/.env
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string_here` with your actual connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

Open three separate terminal windows, one for each folder, and run the start commands:

```bash
# Terminal 1: In the /frontend directory
npm start

# Terminal 2: In the /dashboard directory
npm start

# Terminal 3: In the /backend directory
npm start
```

## üîÆ Future Work

I plan to continue improving this application with new features. The next major enhancement will be:

- **Secure User Authentication:** Implement robust user authentication and password protection using **bcrypt.js** to hash user passwords before storing them in the database, enhancing security and privacy.
- **Real-time Price Updates:** Integrate WebSocket for real-time stock price updates.
